# artifact at all. Release prod-1 passed every job and shipped a binary the
# customer could not execute and a `logs/` directory that was not there, both
# lost in the artifact round-trip between the build and the packaging job.
#
# For each platform it checks:
#   * the detached signature verifies under the key committed in scripts/sign.py
#   * the zip's SHA256 matches SHA256SUMS
#   * the binary inside is EXECUTABLE
#   * config.yaml and logs/ are present
#
# gh runs on the host, for its credentials; the signature check runs in a
# container, so nothing needs installing here.
