# Why this exists separately from run.sh:
#
# act cannot execute the release pipeline's build. The espressif action runs a
# nested Docker step that expects its own files at /github/action/, which act
# does not mount, so a local act run dies with "setup_environment.sh: No such
# file or directory" long before anything is built. See readme.md.
#
# So this reproduces the build directly instead: same Python, same PyInstaller,
# same flags the workflow passes, same `--help` smoke test the action runs.
# That is the check that matters, because the failure mode is a binary that
# BUILDS perfectly and dies on its first import - unit tests cannot see it, and
# neither can anything that only inspects the workflow file.
#
# Runs against a clean copy of the TRACKED tree, so an uncommitted .venv or a
# stale dist/ cannot change the result, and nothing is written to your
# working tree.
