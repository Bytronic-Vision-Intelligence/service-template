"""Emitting log lines the collector can actually read.

Nothing in this repository consumes these lines. service-orchestrator tees
every child's stdout to `project/logging/<service>`, and logging-service parses
what arrives. So the contract being tested here lives in another repository,
and the only way to keep it honest is to check the output against that parser's
own expectations.
