"""scripts/package.sh, exercised the way the release workflow calls it.

This runs in CI on every pull request, which the docker-local tooling does not.
Both defects this file guards reached a published release: prod-1 shipped a
binary the customer could not execute and no logs/ directory, and the first
attempt at fixing that failed in CI on a relative out-dir the local test had
been passing absolutely.
