"""Signing a release artefact with the shared SERVICE key.

The signature this produces is checked by the orchestrator before it runs a
service binary. Nothing downstream of here can tell a correctly signed
artefact from one signed by the wrong key -- it can only report that some key
it does not trust was used, months later, on a customer machine. So the
checks that belong here are the ones that cannot be made anywhere else.
